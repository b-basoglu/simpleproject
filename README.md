Created a simple project to use as a sample project in my next videos. I did not pay attention that much for UI design.

In this project I have done following implementations;

* Single activity and two fragments
* Rearrange gradle scripts with dependencies.gradle
* Activity toolbar
* Enabling home button (back button on toolbar) in fragment
* Custom application themes
* Navigation component with safe arguments
* Data passing, state observing between fragment and activity and manage all navigations from activity via base activity and base fragment or Shared ViewModel
* ViewBinding and databinding
